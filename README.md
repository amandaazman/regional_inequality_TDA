# 🏡 Regional Inequality in Liverpool and Manchester: A Topological Approach

What if we could map inequality not just with numbers, but with **shapes**? Imagine policymakers seeing **this** instead of rows in Excel.

This project explores **how deprivation manifests across 14 wards in Liverpool and Manchester**. By combining traditional regression models with **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**, my team members and I uncover not only what drives inequality, but how it's clustered, shaped, and structured across space. Variables include:
- Household deprivation (0 to 4 dimensions)
- Education: no qualifications, level 4+
- Language proficiency
- Health status
- Vehicle ownership
- Age (65+)

## 🔍 Research Objectives

- Identify ward-level inequality drivers across Manchester and Liverpool
- Apply BallMapper to visualise relationships between Census variables and deprivation
- Evaluate model robustness by adjusting radius and explanatory variables
- Compare classical (OLS) and topological insights for policy relevance

## 📈 Tools Used
1. 🧮 OLS Regression: For measuring linear relationships and statistical strength
2. 🧩 BallMapper (TDA): For visualizing high-dimensional clusters and outliers
3. 🧪 Robustness Checks: Adjusted radius (ε = 10–20) and variable swaps to test model reliability
4. 📊 EDA & Correlation Analysis: Pairplots, heatmaps, and more
